# arduino

This repository contains my Arduino projects. I started with fifteen projects from the Arduino Projects Book. I also make many DIY projects.

See more on my blog about these projects at [Notes of PhiL](https://philectron.github.io/categories/#Arduino).

## Preferences

To customize the default sketchbook, edit [BareMinimum.ino](/Preferences/BareMinimum.ino). Next, copy to `%programfiles(x86)%\Arduino\examples\01.Basics\BareMinimum`, then replace the old file and mark the file as **Read-Only**.

To customize preferences for Arduino IDE, edit [preferences.txt](/Preferences/preferences.txt). Next, copy the file to `%localappdata%\Arduino15` and replace the old one.
